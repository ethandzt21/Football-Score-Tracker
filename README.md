Score Tracker for American Football with Python Tkinter GUI

During the NFL season, the scores must be closely monitored to ensure the fairness of the high intensity games. To make this scoring process as easy as possible, we made a simple score tracker specifically desgined for American Football.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from the recent news of the NFL star Tom Brady and his return to the league soon after his retirement decision. We were often intrigued about the NFL scoring system and thus we wanted to create a simple score-tracking program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to increase user-friendliness.

## What it does
The program has 6 buttons that allows the user to add score to either the home or visiting team and 2 additional buttons to reset the score tracker or exit the program. With the color blue representing the home team and the color red representing the visting team, the user can click on each corresponding button to add 3 points for a Field Goal, 6 points for a Touch Down, and 1 point for a Field Kick. The scores will be automatically calculated and updated on the GUI for the user, and the color differentiation between the home and visiting team also makes the scoring process straighforward. The reset button, just like its name, resets the scores for both teams in preparation for a new game, and the quit button simply provides an easy way for the user to exit the program safely.

## How we built it
We built this GUI score tracker program with the Python Tkinter (Tk interface) module, which is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. We also used Replit as an online IDE for collaboration purposes but we sticked with PyCharm as our main development IDE since we are working with Python.

## Challenges we ran into
Since we had a pretty clear determination of what we were trying to achieve, we did not encounter much challenges in the development process except that we had to research about the tkinter module's functions and event handlers.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
We learned more about the Python Tkinter GUI module and its fundamental structure of creating a root window, and we also learned how to create event listener and handlers to monitor and react to events such as clicking a button in the program.

## What's next for Football Score Tracker
For our next step, we plan on transforming this simple tracker program into a fully functioning app with android studio and thus recoding it with Java and work a bit more on the aesthetics of the user interface. We also decided to allow different kinds of data input to provide statistical analysis of the teams which could potentially benefit both the NFL viewers and professional teams.
