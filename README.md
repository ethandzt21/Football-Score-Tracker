Score Tracker for American Football with Python Tkinter GUI

During Football games, the score must be tracked by the NFL. To make this process as easy as can be, we made a score tracker. 
Everytime you score a touchdown, click the button and it adds 6 points. 
For a field goal it will add 3 points and for a field kick it will add one point.
